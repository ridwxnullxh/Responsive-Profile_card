            Front-end developer crafting accessible, responsive interfaces with
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I build component-driven React
            applications focused on performance, usability, and pixel-perfect
            design. I enjoy designing and maintaining scalable design systems,
            writing clear documentation, and creating reusable UI components
            that work across devices and assistive technologies. My workflow
            emphasizes accessibility (WCAG), semantic markup, automated testing,
            and performance optimization, while balancing pragmatic trade-offs
            to ship features reliably. I collaborate closely with designers,
            product managers, and backend engineers, mentor junior developers,
            and continually learn new tools like TypeScript, modern build
            tooling, and testing frameworks to improve both developer experience
            and end-user outcomes.

            I sometimes struggle with complex state management and backend
            integrations. I'm also working on test-driven development habits.

            Keep practicing, ship small features often, and remember to
            prioritize accessibility from the start.
